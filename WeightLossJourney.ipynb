    "# Weight Loss Journey simple tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in about 2013 I was on a weight loss journey and to keep track of my progress, instead of writing it down or using an app, I chose to challenge myself by using MySQL to keep track, because I needed practice with my SQL statements. That table is now well and gone, but it did help me know how well I did. In August of 2022, I wanted to restart my weight loss journey, and wrote a simple Python script to save my progress into a csv file. The reasoning was several fold. I wanted to keep my Python and Pandas up to par, I wanted to play around with widgets, and also I took that csv file and loaded it into Power BI for my first attempt at making a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look for yourself for a quick rewrite of it, to tidy it up a bit. It's still incredibly simple code, but effective. And I plan on adding more stuff including a matplotlib graph as well as other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "It's better if you run one cell at a time. Running them all will populate the same line."
